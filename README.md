# Library-Management-System
A simple library management system is created by using PYTHON programming language.

Enter D: to display all the available books
Enter B: to borrow books from the library
Enter R: to return books from the library
Enter E: to exit the library

All the books available will be stored in an external text file.
And the information of user who borrows the book is also stored in an external text file.
And the information of user who returns the book is also stored in an external text file.
The date of borrowing and returning will be calculated and fine is charged accordingly.
A unique code is asked to entered while borrowing or returning the book to avoid overwriting 
in the text file(where users data is stored) of user with same user name.
